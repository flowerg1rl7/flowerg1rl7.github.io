                        <p> As a law student with no prior tech experience, I was initially intimidated by the world of coding. However, when I discovered Bright Network's 5-week coding program, I saw an opportunity to explore a completely new realm. I signed up with an open mind, eager to learn the basics of HTML and coding. The program was well-structured and engaging, breaking down complex concepts into manageable lessons. Each week, I found myself becoming more comfortable with the material, as the supportive community and interactive exercises made learning enjoyable. The instructors were knowledgeable and always willing to help, creating an encouraging environment for beginners like me.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "Coding can be fun!" - <cite> Johnson, 2024 </cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            As I progressed through the course, I began to appreciate the creativity and problem-solving aspects of coding. Each module introduced me to different HTML elements, and I learned how to structure web pages effectively. The hands-on projects allowed me to apply what I learned in real-time, reinforcing my understanding of the concepts. I was particularly excited when I got the chance to build my own website. With each line of code I wrote, I felt a sense of accomplishment and empowerment. The process taught me that coding is not just for tech-savvy individuals; it's a skill anyone can learn with dedication and the right guidance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of the program, I had created a fully functional website that reflected my unique interests and style. It was exhilarating to see my ideas come to life through coding. The experience has not only equipped me with valuable technical skills but also boosted my confidence. I now feel more adaptable in today's digital world, even as a law student. This journey from Couch 2 Coder has transformed my perspective on technology and its role in various fields, including law. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn coding and excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that lie ahead.

                        <h2> Choosing a Path: Law or Tech? </h2>
                        <h3><i> By Yasmin Johnson </i></h3>

                        <p> When considering a career in tech or law, the decision can feel overwhelming, as each path offers unique opportunities and challenges. Tech careers are often associated with innovation, creativity, and rapid advancement. Professionals in this field can work on exciting projects like artificial intelligence, software development, and data analysis, often enjoying flexible work environments and competitive salaries. Moreover, the tech industry is continuously evolving, which can be invigorating for those who thrive on change. However, the fast-paced nature of tech can also lead to high levels of stress, requiring individuals to constantly update their skills and knowledge to stay relevant. </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "For the legal profession itself, AI represents both a threat and an opportunity." - <cite> Wakefield, 2023 </cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, a career in law is rooted in tradition and stability, offering a clear path through structured education and training. Lawyers have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on society, advocating for justice and representing clients in various legal matters. The legal profession values analytical thinking, attention to detail, and strong communication skills, which are essential for success. While the law may seem less dynamic than tech, it is a field that constantly evolves with new legislation and societal changes. Additionally, the law can be highly rewarding both intellectually and emotionally, especially when it comes to helping clients navigate complex legal challenges. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, tech and law careers are not mutually exclusive; they intersect in increasingly significant ways. The rise of technology in the legal field has given birth to legal tech, which streamlines processes like contract management and case research. As the legal profession embraces these advancements, lawyers must adapt to new tools and platforms, blending legal expertise with technological know-how. Conversely, tech professionals can benefit from an understanding of the legal landscape, ensuring their innovations comply with regulations. In conclusion, while tech and law offer distinct paths, their intersection provides opportunities for collaboration and growth, enriching both fields and paving the way for a future where technology and law work hand in hand.
